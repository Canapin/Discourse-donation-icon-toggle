# Discourse-donation-icon-toggle

The component only shows or hide a button added with https://meta.discourse.org/t/custom-header-links-icons/86307?u=canapin.

It needs to be forked for your own purpose, it won't work out of the shelf.

It could be easily improved to work with any installation or Discourse element.
